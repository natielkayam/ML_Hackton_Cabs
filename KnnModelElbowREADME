Hackathon Data Analysis
This repository showcases an impressive data analysis project conducted during the Rupin Academic Center's Hackathon 2023. 
The goal was to predict the number of taxis in New York at a specific time and day, using historical taxi traffic data.

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
The initial dataset, stored in the file "CABS.csv," underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing. 
Unnecessary columns related to payment information and passenger count were removed, ensuring a streamlined dataset. 
The pickup and dropoff timestamps were transformed into datetime format for further analysis.
To enhance the predictive power of the model, additional features were engineered. 
Key information such as hour, day, month, and day of the week was extracted from the timestamps. 
Moreover, innovative features were created, including indicators for tourist season, holidays, and rush hour rides. 
The data was even categorized into seasons to provide deeper insights.

Model Training and Evaluation
A state-of-the-art K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model was meticulously trained on the prepared dataset. 
The elbow method was employed to determine the optimal value of K, ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability. 
The model was trained using a combination of the training and test datasets, ensuring comprehensive learning.

Impressively, the trained KNN model demonstrated remarkable performance during evaluation. 
The achieved train and test scores of 0.964 and 0.924, respectively, attest to the robustness and generalizability of the model. 
Moreover, when tested with external data, the model achieved an exceptional R-squared score of 0.934. 
This score signifies the high level of accuracy and precision in predicting taxi counts based on the provided features.

Results and Future Directions
The predictions made by the trained model were thoroughly compared against actual taxi counts, resulting in minimal differences. 
The absolute differences between predicted and actual counts were calculated and saved for further analysis.

This exemplary data analysis project stands as a testament to the team's expertise and commitment to excellence. 
The outcomes achieved, including the high model performance and the remarkable accuracy in predicting taxi counts, are a source of immense pride. 
These results not only demonstrate the team's skill in handling complex datasets but also highlight the potential for real-world applications of data analysis in optimizing taxi services and urban transportation systems.

Moving forward, this project opens up numerous possibilities for further research and enhancements. 
The insights gained from this analysis can inform strategic decision-making processes for taxi companies, traffic management authorities, and urban planners alike. 
By leveraging the power of data, we can continue to shape and optimize transportation systems for the benefit of all.
