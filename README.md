# ML_Hackton_Cabs
Hi, I'm excited to share with you that I participated in the Rupin Academic Center's Hackathon 2023 on May 11-12. The hackathon focused on analyzing taxi traffic data in New York with the objective of predicting the number of taxis at a given time and day.

During the competition, our team worked diligently to explore and analyze the provided dataset. We applied machine learning techniques, specifically using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, to develop a predictive model. Our model took into account various factors such as the pickup hour, day, month, tourist season, holiday, season, and rush hour rides to make accurate predictions.

I'm delighted to present the results of our hard work. We have generated predictions for the number of taxis based on the given features. To assess the performance of our model, we calculated the R-squared score, which indicates how well the predicted values fit the actual values.

Furthermore, I have prepared a CSV file containing the actual count of taxis, the predicted count, and a score indicating the difference between the actual and predicted counts for each data point. This will provide a comprehensive overview of our model's performance.

I invite you to take a look at the attached CSV file and explore the predictions we made during the hackathon. If you have any questions or would like to discuss our approach in more detail, I would be more than happy to share my insights.

Thank you for your support, and I hope you find our work interesting and valuable!
